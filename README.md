# gruber

A not very functional (yet) Markdown parser written in Haskell

:warning: This is a WIP :warning: 

## Features, aka what it can parse

- Headings
- Inline formatting inside headings

That's it.

## Spec

I'm basing the implementation of the grammar on the latest
[CommonMark spec](http://spec.commonmark.org/0.20/)

## Name

I hope it's not going to be an issue using the name of the creator of Markdown,
John Gruber, as the name of the library.  
If I'll get any complaint I'll be happy to rename it.
